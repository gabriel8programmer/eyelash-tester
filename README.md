# Presentations

Welcome to your new React Native project! This project was bootstrapped using the **@react-native-community/cli**. Below, you'll find detailed instructions to get started and explore the project.

## About the Project

This is a **Virtual Eyelash Tester** application. The app allows users to:
- Select a photo from their device gallery or take a new photo using the camera.
- Process the selected or captured image.
- Overlay virtual eyelash images onto the user's photo to simulate the appearance of wearing false eyelashes.

---

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have completed the **React Native - Environment Setup** instructions up to the "Creating a new application" step:
- [React Native Environment Setup Guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)

Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (LTS version recommended)
- **npm** or **Yarn** (dependency managers)
- **Android Studio** (for Android development) or **Xcode** (for iOS development)

---

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Start the Metro Server
Metro is the JavaScript bundler that comes with React Native. Start the server by running the following command from the root of your project:

```bash
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

Let the Metro Bundler run in its own terminal window.

---

### Step 2: Run Your Application
Open a new terminal in the root of your project to launch your app on the desired platform.

#### For Android:

```bash
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

Ensure that your Android Emulator is running or that a physical device is connected and properly set up for development.

#### For iOS:

```bash
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

Ensure your iOS Simulator is set up or that a physical iOS device is connected and provisioned.

> **Note:** You can also run the app directly from **Android Studio** or **Xcode**.

### Step 3: Modify Your Application
Once the app is running, you can start customizing it.

1. Open the `App.tsx` file in your text editor.
2. Make your changes.
3. Reload the app to see the changes:
   - **Android:** Press `R` twice or open the Developer Menu (`Ctrl + M` on Windows/Linux, `Cmd âŒ˜ + M` on macOS) and select "Reload."
   - **iOS:** Press `Cmd âŒ˜ + R` in the iOS Simulator.
